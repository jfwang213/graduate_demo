1、LayerMMO中的poc_params是保存所有的解码的图片的，所以如果一个不是参考的图片解码后应该放在这里，然后滑动窗口机制会将其清除出dpb，然后最后得到显示。
	the function of poc_params is the display order.
2.	 opensvc add one kind of mmco, which is to remove unused shortref, if there is not unused shortref,  the frame inserted into shortref is removed.
3、what is the function of EndOfSlice? 
	track end_of_slice
		slice_header_svc
		in the function B_cavlc, if all mbs are decoded, end_of_slice = 1, Otherwise, it is set to 0.
		
	before decode one slice : 	if end_of_slice is equal to 0, the current picture store nothing about this layer.
								if end_of_slice is equal to 1,the current picture store some part of this layer.
	after decode one slice:		if end_of_slice is equal to 0, the current layer's mbs are all decoded.
								otherwise, part of current layer's mbs are in the next vcl nal unit.
4. Is the frame num of one access unit the same?
	The frame_num of a dependency representation should be the same.
	
5. when is the time of ref_pic_marking?
	there are only one ref_pic_marking in one dependence representation. So the time of executing ref_pic_marking is after decoding all layers of one dependence representation.
	
6. track mmo->LayerId
	MMO->LayerId is equal to this nal->LayerId
7. If the layer dqid > dqIdToDisplay, the frame is ghost
8. Nal LastDqId. LastLayerId LastTemporalId is equal to Last Nal.
9. When to clean POC and how to get pic to display.
	the code is Finish FinishFrameSVC DisplayOrderSvc.
	DisplayOrderSvc is invoked in two place, The first is invoked in function FinishFrameSVC, when layerDqId is not higher than dqIdToDisplay. The other is invoked in main. when layerDqId is higher than dqIdToDisplay.
	if it is last slice in AU, remove the poc in layerMMO, and check toDisplayLayerMMo to verify whether there is a picture to display.
10. when to ref pic marking
	The ref_pic_marking function is invoked after every layer decoding.
*11. use_ref_base_layer.
	
12. track ref_layer_dq_id
	the syntax is read by function SvcReadLayerPrediction
	Nal->BaseMvMemoryAddress and BaseMemoryAddress store the address of picture buffer and mv buffer address of base layer.
13. poc is calculated once for one dependence representation.

*14. why is cabac's mv and ref memory different?
*15. What is the function of vlc_tables?
*16. track UsedSpatial.
	if (layer1<layer2 && UsedSpatial[layer1][layer2]=1),
		it means spatial resolution of layer1 is different from layer2.
17. the InitialMemoryAddress bug doesn't exist.
	if there are correspond picture in display layer, UpdateReferenceListAddress will replace the error picture with the correspond picture.
*18. Familiar with picnum poc frame_num.
	done
19.	the procedure of reference picture marking in svc.
		1. IDR picture. long_term_reference_flag
		2. not IDR picture. 
			if adaptive_ref_base_pic_marking_mode_flag is equal to 1, ref_base_pic_marking.
			if adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag is equal to 1, ref_pic_marking, else slide window.
			if current picture is not marked long-term, it is marked as short term
			the reference base picture's state is the same as the current picture.

*20.	when is current_pic reference set?
*21.	when are current pic x_size and y_size set?
22.	Is size_mb enough?
*23.	what is PMbInfo's function?
24.	NalParamInit initial the nal parameter of up_width,up_height and SpatialScalability.
25.	RefPartitionL0 is different when nal->baseLayerId is different.
	the default value of motion prediction is wrong.
26.	what is the function of non_zero_count_cache?
27.	what does interlayer prediction need?
	One residual struct and one List_MMO struct.
28.	mb_slice_group_map should be in layermmo struct.
	because mb_slice_group_map can change when layer representation is end.
